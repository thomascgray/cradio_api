Cradio - Collaborative Youtube Radio

*Very WIP!*

The eventual idea is that you'll log onto the site, join a room, and watch Youtube with your friends.

You'll be able to search and add videos to the room your in. The frontend will be entirely React.js driven,
and this codebase will form the eventual API.

Progress Log

- Got basic room creation and joining done - aiming to be entirely RESTful,
except for some minor actions (room generation, etc.)
- Gotta wire in Socket.io to send and receive events
- And THEN wire in React.js, easy
